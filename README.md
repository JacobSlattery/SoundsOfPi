Simple coding concept I have always wanted to do and forgot about until now
The core idea is that numbers can be mapped to keys, so any numeric sequence can become a melody. Taking it a step further and you can programmatically play some harmony with a melody and generate the sound waves with math.
This is incomplete as far as full scope but it does work at a base level
